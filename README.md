I chose to build this website on my grandmother, Nadra Peretz.
She died one month ago. She was 88 years old.
My grandmother was borned in Iraq, and she had a difficualt life.
When she married my grandfather, she was 16 years old. 
My grandfather died 20 years ago, when i was 6 years old.

The website conatins:
	- A short background about her life.
	- Pictures of her from diffrent times.
	- A playlist of songs she loved.
	- Answers for the questions from the assignment.
	- A way to contact me through an e-mail.


The URL for my website is:

Enjoy :)
